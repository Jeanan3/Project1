# Project1
This code determines the generation that a person is a part of based on user a user inputed age variable.

## Getting Started
1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone git@github.com:ciaradwyer/Project1.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Project1`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `CodeP1.ipynb` notebook.

### Part-1 (Code description)
This code determines the generation that a person is a part of. 

This code asks the user for their name and their age. It stores both of these inputs into variables to be used later. The code then prints out a statement using the name input variable. Next, the code determines with if/elif statements what generation the user belongs to based on the age input varibiable. Once determined, a statemtent informing the user which generation they are a part of is printed and the code ends.
