This code determines the generation that a person is a part of. 

This code asks the user for their name and their age. It stores both of these inputs into variables to be used later. The code then prints out a statement using the name input variable. Next, the code determines with if/elif statements what generation the user belongs to based on the age input varibiable. Once determined, a statemtent informing the user which generation they are a part of is printed and the code ends.
